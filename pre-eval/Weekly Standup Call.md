# ðŸŽ¤ Simulated Weekly Stand-Up Call (Live)

- âœ… **Yesterday:** "Hi everyone, Iâ€™m Gezahegne. Yesterday, I was setting up my environment to build my first verion of chatBot model and that is completed successfully. 

- ðŸ›  **Today:** Today I will work on building the chatbot.

- â›” **Blockers:** One blocker I was encouter is my machine has low spec to train the model locally, and finally I have setup a cloud environment to run the model based on recommendations from slack colleagues.

:question:Would the corpus db for the chatbot need any type of authentication or not? 	
Thank you.

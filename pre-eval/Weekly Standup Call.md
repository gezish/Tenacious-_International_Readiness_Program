# ðŸŽ¤ Simulated Weekly Stand-Up Call (Live)

 âœ… **Yesterday:** "Hi everyone, Iâ€™m Gezahegne. Yesterday, I set up my environment to build my first version of the chatbot model, including my repository, and that was completed successfully. 

 ðŸ›  **Today:** Today, I will work on building the chatbot.

 â›” **Blockers:** One blocker I encountered is that my machine has low specs to train the model locally, and finally, I have set up a cloud environment to run the model based on recommendations from Slack colleagues.

:question: Would the corpus DB for the chatbot need any type of authentication or not? 	
Thank you.

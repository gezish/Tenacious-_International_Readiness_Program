This week has been focused on finalizing backend integrations, improving test coverage, and preparing for upcoming frontend work. Several items are in progress, one task is completed, and a few require clarification or assignment.

‚úÖ **Done**

- **T-101 - API Endpoint for Rewards Summary** (Sam): Started last week, PR pending merge. Possible blocker ‚Äî need to confirm status.
- **T-106 - Fix Login Button on Mobile** (Sara): Work started this morning. Some confusion around reproduction steps needs clarification.

üîç **In Review**
- **T-103 - Test Coverage for Rewards Module** (You): All tests written. Awaiting code review.

üìã **To Do**
- **T-102 - Frontend UI for Dashboard Graphs** (Sara): Design handoff pending. Figma file not updated yet.
- **T-105 - Write Internal Release Notes**: Unassigned. Likely needed for stakeholder sync.
- **T-107 - Add Tooltips to Charts**: Unscoped and unassigned. Mentioned in Slack, but no action yet.

üö© **Blockers & Risks**
- T-101 may be stuck due to unmerged PR.

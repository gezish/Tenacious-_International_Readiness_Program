# 🛍️ AI Shopping Assistant MVP

A personalized e-commerce shopping assistant built with **LangChain + OpenAI GPT-4** (or local LLMs like Ollama) that helps customers find and purchase products through natural conversation.

## 🎯 Use Case

This MVP demonstrates how Agentic AI can transform the e-commerce shopping experience by:
- Providing personalized product recommendations
- Guiding customers through the purchase process
- Handling post-purchase support
- Learning from user preferences and behavior

## 🏗️ Architecture & Agent Workflow

The agentic workflow is designed to guide the user through a personalized shopping journey, as shown below:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["User starts chat"] --> B["Agent greets & asks needs"]
    B --> C["Agent gathers preferences"]
    C --> D["Agent searches product catalog"]
    D --> E["Agent presents recommendations"]
    E --> F{"User wants to compare/refine?"}
    F -- Yes --> C
    F -- No --> G["Agent offers tracking/support"]
```

**Workflow Steps:**
1. **User starts chat:** The user initiates a conversation with the shopping assistant.
2. **Agent greets & asks needs:** The agent welcomes the user and inquires about their shopping goals.
3. **Agent gathers preferences:** The agent collects user preferences (e.g., category, budget, brand).
4. **Agent searches product catalog:** The agent queries the product API for matching items.
5. **Agent presents recommendations:** The agent displays top product options and details.
6. **Decision loop:** If the user wants to compare or refine, the agent loops back to gather more preferences; otherwise, it proceeds.
7. **Agent offers tracking/support:** After a decision, the agent helps with order tracking or support as needed.

This agentic workflow enables a dynamic, context-aware, and goal-driven shopping experience, far beyond a simple prompt-based chatbot.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key **or** a local LLM (e.g., Ollama)
- pip (Python package manager)

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy environment template
cp config.env.example .env

# Edit .env file with your OpenAI API key (if using OpenAI)
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 2. Start the Mock E-commerce APIs
```bash
python mock_apis.py
```
This starts the mock backend services on port 8001 (or your chosen port).

### 3. Start the Shopping Assistant
```bash
python web_interface.py
```
This starts the web interface on port 8000 (or your chosen port).

### 4. Access the Application
Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000`

## 🎮 How to Use

### Web Interface
1. **Open the chat interface** at `http://localhost:8000`
2. **Start chatting** with the shopping assistant
3. **Try these example conversations**:

```
User: "I'm looking for wireless headphones"
Assistant: [Searches and recommends products]

User: "What's my budget range?"
Assistant: [Shows user preferences]

User: "I want to buy the TechSound headphones"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. OpenAI API Key Error**
```
Error: Invalid API key
```
Solution: Check your `.env` file and ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly.

**2. Port Already in Use**
```
Error: Address already in use
```
Solution: Change ports in the respective files or kill existing processes.

**3. Import Errors**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langchain'
```
Solution: Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
